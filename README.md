## 📖 About Us

**RJS Music School Ltd.** is an innovative online music education platform, operating as part of the non-profit organization **"Russe Jazz Colleague"**.

Our mission is to build a bridge between established names in the Bulgarian music industry and musicians who are just starting their journey or looking to refine their craft. We believe that the modern musician must master not only their instrument but also the technical aspects of the profession.

## 🎯 Our Goal

We help musicians of all levels — from **beginners** to **intermediates** and **professionals** — to outgrow their current abilities. Our focus is dual-layered:

1.  **Instrumental Mastery:** Lessons taught by instructors with proven track records and established names in the industry.
2.  **Technical Proficiency:** Training in essential areas such as live sound engineering, working with backing tracks, studio production, and music software.

## 🚀 What We Are Building

The platform is designed to be a comprehensive hub for musical knowledge:

* 🎸 **Masterclasses & Lessons:** Led by members of the Russe Jazz Colleague and guest lecturers.
* 🎛️ **Tech for Musicians:** Courses covering the technical side of a music career—skills often missing from traditional academic education.
* 🤝 **Community:** An environment for experience exchange between generations of musicians.

---

## 🛠️ The Team

Currently, the **RJS Music School** project is in an active **"Under Construction"** phase.

While the initiative is backed by the authority and network of the "Russe Jazz Colleague," the technical development of the platform is currently driven by a small, dedicated core team (a Dev Team of One 💻).

> *"Even a lone warrior is a force to be reckoned with when the cause is right."* 😅
